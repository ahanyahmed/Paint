# Paint
Paint program by applying OOP principles using JAVA GUI
For a Programming 2 project, I developed a user-friendly
paint application using Java GUI and OOP principles that
allowed users to draw and color shapes, including circles,
triangles, rectangles, and lines. The application also featured
drag-and-drop functionality and easy resizing and
manipulation of shapes, as well as deletion and recoloring
options.
